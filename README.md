# gmestan

This repository provides examples for using Stan to create a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the mass of the Milky Way using kinematic data from tracers.

## GME model

This repository contains a Stan port of [GME](https://github.com/gweneadie/GME). There are two models, [`models/gc.stan`](models/gc.stan) and [`models/dg.stan`](models/dg.stan), which can be used to reproduce the results of [Eadie and JuriÄ‡ 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...875..159E/abstract) and Slizewski et. al (submitted to ApJ) respectively. These models assume independence between the two proper motions (RA and DEC), do not incorporate covariances between phase-space parameters, and the results are produced with complete data only.

Example files for how to use the models are in [`examples/gme_py.ipynb`](examples/gme_py.ipynb) for Python and [`examples/gme.r`](examples/gme.r) for R. 

Two accompanying datasets are provided:

- [`GC_Vasiliev.csv`](data/GC_Vasiliev.csv): a globular cluster dataset from [Vasiliev 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.2832V/abstract)
- [`DG_Fritz.csv`](data/DG_Fritz.csv): a dwarf galaxy dataset from [Fritz 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A.103F/abstract)

## Extended model

The extended model used for analysis of H3 halo stars is provided in [`models/h3p.stan`](models/h3p.stan). The model can deal with missing positions and/or velocities, and incorporates within-source covariances.

There are again two examples, [`examples/h3.ipynb`](examples/h3.ipynb) and [`examples/h3.r`](examples/h3.r). Bring your own data!

## Python

To install [CmdStanPy](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy) (a lightweight Python interface to Stan), see the instructions [here](https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.76/installation.html).

The Python examples are Jupyter notebooks. Apart from Pystan and Jupyter, the necessary dependencies to run all the code in the notebook can be installed through `pip` with the following line:

```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib arviz seaborn
```

## R

To install [CmdStanR](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) (the R interface to CmdStan), see the instructions [here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).

I recommend opening the provided R files in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Apart from CmdStanR, the necessary depenencies to run all the code can be installed with the following line:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "latex2exp", "bayesplot", "shinystan", "ggridges", "reshape2", "posterior"), dependencies=TRUE)
```
